## Modified VoxPoser

This is the demo code for the WizardCoder-powered VoxPoser, a method that uses large language models and vision-language models to zero-shot synthesize trajectories for manipulation tasks. The original code can be found at [VoxPoser](https://voxposer.github.io/)

In this repo, we provide the implementation of modified VoxPoser in [RLBench](https://sites.google.com/view/rlbench).


## Setup Instructions

Note that this codebase is best run with a display. For running in headless mode, refer to the [instructions in RLBench](https://github.com/stepjam/RLBench#running-headless).

- Create a conda environment:
```Shell
conda create -n voxposer-env python=3.9
conda activate voxposer-env
```

- See [Instructions](https://github.com/stepjam/RLBench#install) to install PyRep and RLBench (Note: install these inside the created conda environment).

- Install other dependencies:
```Shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running Demo

Demo code is at `src/eval_C.ipynb`. Instructions can be found in the notebook.

## Code Structure

Core to VoxPoser:

- **`playground.ipynb`**: Playground for VoxPoser.
- **`LMP.py`**: Implementation of Language Model Programs (LMPs) that recursively generates code to decompose instructions and compose value maps for each sub-task.
- **`interfaces.py`**: Interface that provides necessary APIs for language models (i.e., LMPs) to operate in voxel space and to invoke motion planner.
- **`planners.py`**: Implementation of a greedy planner that plans a trajectory (represented as a series of waypoints) for an entity/movable given a value map.
- **`controllers.py`**: Given a waypoint for an entity/movable, the controller applies (a series of) robot actions to achieve the waypoint.
- **`dynamics_models.py`**: Environment dynamics model for the case where entity/movable is an object or object part. This is used in `controllers.py` to perform MPC.
- **`prompts/rlbench`**: Prompts used by the different Language Model Programs (LMPs) in VoxPoser.

Environment and utilities:

- **`envs`**:
  - **`rlbench_env.py`**: Wrapper of RLBench env to expose useful functions for VoxPoser.
  - **`task_object_names.json`**: Mapping of object names exposed to VoxPoser and their corresponding scene object names for each individual task.
- **`configs/rlbench_config.yaml`**: Config file for all the involved modules in RLBench environment.
- **`arguments.py`**: Argument parser for the config file.
- **`LLM_cache.py`**: Caching of language model outputs that writes to disk to save cost and time.
- **`utils.py`**: Utility functions.
- **`visualizers.py`**: A Plotly-based visualizer for value maps and planned trajectories.
